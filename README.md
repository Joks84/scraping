# This project is for educational purposes only (and to show an example of web scraping tools).
 The main goal was to create Django app which will behave like Content Aggregator (for jobs).
 
 In order to build the content aggregator, I've used BeautifulSoup which helps to create scraping tasks.
 The tasks have their own schedule on when to do the scraping.
 Scheduling was set with the help of Celery.
